# This file contains combined synonym sets generated by merging multiple synonym files.
# Synonym sets with overlapping terms are merged into a single set, and duplicate entries are removed.
# Each line contains synonyms, separated by commas, which can be used in Elasticsearch or other search systems.
# The lines are automatically deduplicated and sorted for clarity and performance.
# Example:
# car, automobile, vehicle, auto

# IMPORTANT: This combined synonym file should be reviewed by a human to ensure accuracy.
# Automatic merging of synonyms can sometimes lead to erroneous or misleading synonym sets.
# For example, if one file contains:
#   bank, financial institution
# and another file contains:
#   bank, riverbank
# The resulting merged line might be:
#   bank, financial institution, riverbank
# which could lead to confusion in search results. Review these cases carefully.

# Files combined:
