# This file contains combined synonym sets generated by merging multiple synonym files.
# Synonym sets with overlapping terms are merged into a single set, and duplicate entries are removed.
# Each line contains synonyms, separated by commas, which can be used in Elasticsearch or other search systems.
# The lines are automatically deduplicated and sorted for clarity and performance.
# Example:
# power plant => power plant, power station, generating station, generation facility

# IMPORTANT: This combined synonym file should be reviewed by a human to ensure accuracy.
# One-way synonyms are written on separate lines to ensure correct handling in Elasticsearch.
