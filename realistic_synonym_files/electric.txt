# In some cases, one-way synonyms may be more appropriate. One-way synonyms expand only in one direction.
# Example of a one-way synonym rule:
# power plant => power plant, power station, generating station, generation facility
# This ensures 'power plant' will expand to itself and related terms, but searching for 'power station' or 'generating station' will not expand to 'power plant.'

# One-way synonym rules detected:
power plant => power plant, power station, generating station, generation facility
solar farm => solar farm, solar array, photovoltaic plant, PV plant
wind farm => wind farm, wind park, wind power plant, wind energy facility
