# In some cases, one-way synonyms may be more appropriate. One-way synonyms expand only in one direction.
# Example of a one-way synonym rule:
# project management => project management, project administration, project coordination, project oversight
# This ensures 'project management' will expand to itself and related roles, but not the other way around.
