# In some cases, one-way synonyms may be more appropriate. One-way synonyms expand only in one direction.
# Example of a one-way synonym rule:
# recruitment => recruitment, hiring, talent acquisition
# This ensures 'recruitment' will expand to related terms, but 'hiring' or 'talent acquisition' will not expand to 'recruitment.'
